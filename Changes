Revision history for Perl extension String::Random:

0.22   Thu Sep 21 2006
- Fix README to reflect current reality.
- Random cleanup in this file.
- Since we've broken compatibility with *really* old Perl5 anyway,
  modernize a bit more ("our" instead of "use vars").  Also
  explicitly require 5.6.1.

0.21   Thu Apr 20 2006
- Modify test.pl to use Test::More.
- Build with Module::Build.
- Minor whitespace cleanup.
- Avoid undefined results from randregex() and randpattern().
- Turn on warnings in the module.

0.20   Mon Sep 29 2003
- Added support for *, +, and ? in regular expressions.

0.1992 Thu Jul 25 2002
- Added support for {n,m} ranges in regular expressions.
- Cleaned up the initialization of @punct.

0.1991 Thu Feb 28 2002
- Added a "b" for random binary data in randpattern().

0.199  Tue Feb 26 2002
- fixed randregex() and randpattern() to Do The Right Thing(TM)
  when called in an array or scalar context, and when passed
  multiple arguments.
  (* WARNING * This is an incompatible change. Code expecting the
  behavior of earlier versions may break. Of course, the documentation
  warned that this change would be made, and everybody reads
  documentation, right? :-)
- fixed use of $_ in randpattern().
  (Unfortunately, there's still one use of $_ in a grep(), but I don't
  see how that can be avoided, and it only happens once on
  initialization.)

0.198  Tue May 16 2000
- fixed \W generating "_"
- reorganized a bit to make it easier to add more patterns
- added \s and \S
- added two-character literals (\t, \n, \r, \f, \a, \e)

0.197  Sat Jul 10 1999
- moved most of randregex() to %regch
- added random_regex() function interface

0.195  Wed Jul  7 1999
- regex support is (at least mostly) complete

0.19   Sun Jul  4 1999
