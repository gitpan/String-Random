        - Modify test.pl to use Test::More.
        - Build with Module::Build.
        - Minor whitespace cleanup.
        - Avoid undefined results from randregex() and randpattern().

        - Added support for *, +, and ? in regular expressions.

        - Added support for {n,m} ranges in regular expressions.
        - Cleaned up the initialization of @punct.

0.1991 Thu Feb 28 00:00:56 CST 2002
        - Added a "b" for random binary data in randpattern().

0.199  Tue Feb 26 14:01:28 CST 2002
        - fixed randregex() and randpattern() to Do The Right
          Thing(TM) when called in an array or scalar context, and
          when passed multiple arguments
          (* WARNING *  This is an incompatible change.  Code
          expecting the behavior of earlier versions may break.  Of
          course, the documentation warned that this change would be
          made, and everybody reads documentation, right?  :-)
        - fixed use of $_ in randpattern()
          (Unfortunately, there's still one use of $_ in a grep(), but
          I don't see how that can be avoided, and it only happens
          once on initialization.)
