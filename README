String::Random is used to generate random strings.  It was written to
make generating random passwords and such a little easier.  See the
documentation in pod format in the module for more information.

This module requires Perl5.  Any version should work, but it has only
been tested on recent versions (5.6.1 and 5.8.0).

To install the module, simply do the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

                ******  PLEASE NOTE  ******

This module is still somewhat experimental.  I'm trying to determine
exactly what the feature set of the module should be.  Please send
suggestions, bug reports, comments, etc. to the author, Steven
Pritchard <steve@silug.org>.
